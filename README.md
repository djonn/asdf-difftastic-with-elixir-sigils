# DO NOT USE THIS PLUGIN

This is a bastardised ASDF plugin. Do not use it. Instead use the "real one": [asdf-difftastic](https://github.com/volf52/asdf-difftastic/).

This installs a specific non-official version of [difftastic](https://github.com/Wilfred/difftastic) specifically [the PR that improves diffing Elixir sigils](https://github.com/Wilfred/difftastic/pull/785).

This plugin is ONLY able to install that specific version of difftastic.

During installation Difftastic is built from source using Docker.
